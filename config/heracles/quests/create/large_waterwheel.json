      "A /a/Large Water Wheel/a/ is the same as a normal /a/Water Wheel/a/, but it's /c/more expensive/c/ and /c/runs slower/c/.",

      "/6/\"But Mister QuestMan,\" you ask, \"Why would I want that!? I want speed, not expensive slowness!\"/6/ ",
      "    Well, I'm glad you asked. Even though it runs slower, it generates something you'll want much more, eventually: /e/Rotational Force/e/. /e/Rotational Force/e/ and /e/Rotational Speed/e/ are not the same. /e/Rotational Speed/e/ /b/uses no power by itself/b/, and it can always be sped up to the /9/max speed of 256/9/. But as soon as you connect a max-speed shaft to a /e/Component/e/, you'll find that a single /a/Water Wheel/a/ can't handle the /e/stress load/e/ of a max-speed /a/Mechanical Press/a/, /c/overstressing/c/ the mechanism and causing everything to /c/halt to a stop/c/. That's because you have less /e/Rotational Force/e/ than you need: and /a/Large Water Wheels/a/ /b/provide a lot more of that for less/b/, although you'll have to take the initial cost of speeding them up.",
      "",
      "Investing in a large chain of /a/Large Water Wheels/a/ /7/(yes, you can chain them! just connect their shafts together and pour water over all of them)/7/ will do you good for the near future, although you may want to invest in something more complicated in the late-game."
